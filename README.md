# GIS 

This repository contains all project code necessary to create a Geographic Information System (GIS) akin to Google Maps. It is the result of 4 months of hard work by myself
and two team members in the culiminating project of ECE297 - Software Communication and Design at the University of Toronto, and is so marked private to 
prevent academic misuse. If you desire access to the code, feel free to message me and I would be glad to provide it. 

This project was made entirely in C++ with significant use of the STL library - it is a fully functional mapping software that provides a GUI, train stations, and colourblind options for visually impaired users. It uses a form of Dijkstra's Algorithm (A*) and a spacial binary structure called a KD-Tree to efficiently optimize our solution to the travelling salesman problem.
